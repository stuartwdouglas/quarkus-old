/**
 * Indicates that a given method is a build step that is run at deployment time to create the
 * runtime output.
 *
 * <p>BuildStep's are run concurrently at augmentation time to augment the application. They use a
 * producer/consumer model, where a step is guaranteed not to be run until all items that it is
 * consuming have been created.
 *
 * <p>Producing and consuming is done via injection. This can be done via field injection via {@link
 * javax.inject.Inject}, or via method parameter injection.
 *
 * <p>The following types are eligible for injection: - Subclasses of {@link
 * org.jboss.builder.item.SimpleBuildItem} - Lists of subclasses of {@link
 * org.jboss.builder.item.MultiBuildItem} - {@link BuildProducer} instances - Recorder template
 * classes (if the method is annotated {@link Record}) - An instance of {@code BytecodeRecorder} (if
 * the method is annotated {@link Record})
 *
 * <p>Injecting a {@code SimpleBuildItem} or a List of {@code MultiBuildItem} makes this step a
 * consumer of these items, and as such will not be run until all producers of the relevant items
 * has been run.
 *
 * <p>Injecting a {@code BuildProducer} makes this class a producer of this item. Alternatively
 * items can be produced by simply returning them from the method.
 *
 * <p>If field injection is used then every {@code BuildStep} method on the class will be a
 * producer/consumer of these items, while method parameter injection is specific to an individual
 * build step. In general method parameter injection should be the preferred approach as it is more
 * fine grained.
 *
 * <p>Note that a {@code BuildStep}will only be run if there is a consumer for items it produces. If
 * nothing is interested in the produced item then it will not be run. A consequence of this is that
 * it must be capable of producing at least one item (it does not actually have to produce anything,
 * but it must have the ability to). A build step that cannot produce anything will never be run.
 *
 * <p>{@code BuildItem}instances must be immutable, as the producer/consumer model does not allow
 * for mutating artifacts. Injecting a build item and modifying it is a bug waiting to happen, as
 * this operation would not be accounted for in the dependency graph.
 *
 * <p>As injection is done by an annotation processor and not reflection injected fields must not be
 * private. In addition to this {@code BuildStep} methods must also not be private.
